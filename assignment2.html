                The six-time Ballon d'Or winner not only ended the 28-year-long wait for Argentina but also his personal
                duck to win an international trophy at Maracana against Brazil. Lionel Messi had a brilliant Copa
                America 2021 as he scored four goals and had five assists to his name. Even though Colombia's Luis Diaz
                also scored four goals, Messi registered more assists and was named the Golden Boot winner.

                Messi took to Instagram to write: "It was an incredible Copa America. We know that we can still improve
                a lot of things, but the truth is that the guys gave it everything and I can't be more proud to have the
                luck of being captain of this spectacular group.</p>
